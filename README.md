   - Around happy humans who have a life outside of work

🐬 **Best ways to communicate with me**
  - Emails 
  - 1:1
  - Direct message with tag (if requires my urgent attention)

🐳 **How I best receive feedback**
  - Constructive 
  - Perfect when it's driven from "things which could be better" than "everything went wrong, it's you"
     - No to trauma dumping  

🐌 **How I learn best**
  - Give me a taste of the big picture 
  - Being hands-on
  - Organising & asking questions 
  - Big on research + planning, not great with hotfixes

🦄 **Things I struggle with**
  - Asking for help
  - Taking space for myself
  - Finding my beat, when overwhelmed 
  - Expressing my true emotions (often I mask)

🦀 Other things to know about me**
  - Zero tolerance for disrespect
  - Speak but don't mansplain me
  - Active listener
  - Respect my time and I will yours 
  - Over-communication is sweet
  - Neurospicy
